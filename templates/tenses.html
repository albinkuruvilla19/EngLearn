        <h1>Understanding Tenses in English Grammar</h1>
        <p>Tenses are the backbone of English grammar. They indicate the time when an action takes place. Understanding how tenses work will significantly improve your communication skills, allowing you to express when something happens with clarity and precision.</p>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">1. Present Tense</h2>
            <p>The present tense is used to describe actions happening now or regularly.</p>
            <div class="example">
                <strong>Examples:</strong><br>
                - She <strong>reads</strong> every day.<br>
                - The sun <strong>rises</strong> in the east.
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Simple Present:</strong> Expresses habitual actions (e.g., I walk to school.)</li>
                <li><strong>Present Continuous:</strong> Describes actions happening right now (e.g., I am reading.)</li>
                <li><strong>Present Perfect:</strong> Describes actions that happened at an unspecified time (e.g., She has finished her work.)</li>
                <li><strong>Present Perfect Continuous:</strong> Describes actions that started in the past and are still continuing (e.g., They have been studying for hours.)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">2. Past Tense</h2>
            <p>The past tense is used to describe actions that happened at a specific time in the past.</p>
            <div class="example">
                <strong>Examples:</strong><br>
                - He <strong>visited</strong> Paris last year.<br>
                - They <strong>watched</strong> a movie last night.
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Simple Past:</strong> Expresses actions completed in the past (e.g., She finished her homework.)</li>
                <li><strong>Past Continuous:</strong> Describes ongoing actions in the past (e.g., I was eating dinner when she called.)</li>
                <li><strong>Past Perfect:</strong> Describes actions completed before another past action (e.g., He had left before she arrived.)</li>
                <li><strong>Past Perfect Continuous:</strong> Describes actions that were ongoing in the past up to another point (e.g., They had been playing for hours before it started raining.)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">3. Future Tense</h2>
            <p>The future tense is used to describe actions that will happen at a later time.</p>
            <div class="example">
                <strong>Examples:</strong><br>
                - She <strong>will travel</strong> to Japan next year.<br>
                - They <strong>are going to</strong> start a new project soon.
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Simple Future:</strong> Expresses actions that will happen in the future (e.g., We will meet tomorrow.)</li>
                <li><strong>Future Continuous:</strong> Describes ongoing future actions (e.g., I will be waiting for you at 5 PM.)</li>
                <li><strong>Future Perfect:</strong> Describes actions that will be completed before a specific future time (e.g., She will have finished her work by then.)</li>
                <li><strong>Future Perfect Continuous:</strong> Describes actions that will be ongoing up to a future point (e.g., By next month, he will have been working here for a year.)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
